How many bits are required to represent the image data shown in Figure 2? [Method of representing the image data] (1) The image data is represented using a run length encoding scheme. When the run length exceeds 128 (i.e., “10000000” in binary), it is split into multiple run lengths in units of 128. For example, when the run length is 200, it is split into 128 and 72. (2) “1” is subtracted from each value represented in the above (1) so that each value can be represented as a 7-bit binary number. After that, “0 for white” or “1 for black” as a color indicator is appended to the first bit position of each of the 7-bit strings. As a result, each run length is represented as shown below. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Bit position “Run length – 1” (0 through 127) Color bit: “0” for white, “1” for black",
