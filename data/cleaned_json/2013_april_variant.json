Mr. F was instructed by his supervisor to create the study material for selecting the model of an office machine to be used within the department in accordance with the selection requirements shown below. [Selection requirements] (1) Any one model is selected from four similar models (models A through D). (2) There are three evaluation items: price, performance, and service. A weighting factor of 1 through 5 is given in consideration of the importance of each evaluation item. (3) The evaluated value of each evaluation item is decided for each model. The evaluation value is any number from 1 through 9. (4) The overall evaluated value is calculated from the weighting factor and evaluated value of each evaluation item, and the model with the largest overall evaluated value is selected. Mr. F carried out his study by creating the evaluation table shown in Table 1. In this case, the overall evaluated value of model A is calculated by the formula shown below. The similar formula is used for models B through D as well. Overall evaluated value of model A = w1×a1+w2×a2+w3×a3 The meaning of each symbol is as follows: w1 through w3: A weighting factor of each evaluation item of price, performance, and service a1 through a3: Each evaluated value of the price, performance, and service of model A Table 1 Evaluation table Evaluation Weighting Model A Model B Model C Model D item factor Price w1 a1 b1 c1 d1 Performance w2 a2 b2 c2 d2 Service w3 a3 b3 c3 d3 [Strategy]",
