Worksheets\n(1) The work area that is composed of a grid of rows and columns is called a worksheet. A\nworksheet has 256 columns and 10,000 rows.\n(2) The position of each column and row in a worksheet is represented by a column letter and a row\nnumber. The leftmost column letter is A, and all column letters are represented as A, B, ..., Z, AA,\nAB, ..., AZ, BA, BB, ..., BZ, ..., IU, and IV. The uppermost row number is 1, and all row numbers\nare represented as 1, 2, …, 10000.\n(3) Multiple worksheets can be used. In this case, a unique name is assigned to each worksheet in\norder to distinguish worksheets from one another.\n2. Cells and cell ranges\n(1) Each box-shaped area in the grid that constitutes a worksheet is called a cell. The position of a\ncell is represented by a pair of the column letter and row number of the cell, and this is called a cell\naddress.\nExample: The cell address at column A and row 1 is A1.\n(2) When a group of all cells included in certain rectangular area of a worksheet is handled, the cell\naddresses of the top left and bottom right cells of the group are used with a semicolon “ : ”, and the\ngroup is represented as “top left cell address:bottom right cell address”. This is called a cell\nrange.\nExample: The cell range with the top left cell at A1 and the bottom right cell at B3 is represented\nas A1:B3 .\n(3) When a cell address or a cell range in another worksheet is specified, the worksheet name and an\nexclamation mark “!” are used, and they are represented as “worksheet name!cell address” or\n“worksheet name!cell range” respectively.\nExample: When the cell range B5:G10 in the worksheet “sheet1,”is specified from another\nworksheet, it is represented as sheet1!B5:G10.\n3. Values and expressions\n(1) A cell holds a value, and this value can be referenced using the cell address. A value can be a\nnumeric value, a character string, a logical value, or a null value.\n(2) A character string is enclosed in a pair of single quotation marks ‘ ’.\nExample: The character strings “A” and “BC” are represented as ‘A’ and ‘BC’ respectively.\n(3) A logical value is represented as true or false.\n- 45 -\n(4) A null value is represented as null, and a cell that has a null value is called a blank cell. The\ninitial state of a cell is null.\n(5) An expression can be entered into a cell. A cell holds the resulting value of an evaluated\nexpression.\n(6) An expression is composed of constants, cell addresses, operators, parentheses, and functions. A\nconstant is a notation that represents a numeric value, a character string, a logical value, or a null\nvalue. A cell address in an expression refers to the value held in the cell at that cell address.\n(7) An expression can be an arithmetic expression, a character expression, or a logical expression.\nAn expression whose evaluation generates a numeric value is called an arithmetic expression, an\nexpression whose evaluation generates a character string is called a character expression, and an\nexpression whose evaluation generates a logical value is called a logical expression.\n(8) When an expression is entered into a cell, it is evaluated immediately. When the value in a cell\nthat is referenced by an expression is changed, the expression is immediately re-evaluated.\n4. Operators\n(1) Unary operators are the plus sign “+” and the minus sign “−”.\n(2) Arithmetic operators are addition “+”, subtraction “−”, multiplication “*”, division “/”, and\nexponentiation “^”.\n(3) Comparison operators are greater than “>”, less than “<”, greater than or equal to “≥”, less than or\nequal to “≤”, equal to “=”, and not equal to “≠”.\n(4) For grouping symbols, a pair of parentheses “( )” is used.\n(5) When there are multiple operations and parentheses in an expression, the order of calculation is\nprioritized as shown in the table below.\nType of operation Operator Priority\nParentheses ( ) High\nExponentiation ^\nUnary operation +，−\nMultiplication and division *，/\nAddition and subtraction +，−\nComparison operators >，<，≥，≤，=，≠ Low\n5. Copying of cells\n(1) A value or expression in a cell can be copied into other cells.\n(2) In a cell copy operation, when the source cell holds an expression containing a cell address, the cell\nreference method that changes the cell address in the expression so that the difference in the cell\naddresses of the source cell and destination cell can be maintained is called a relative reference.\nIn this case, the expression that is entered into the destination cell is the expression modified by\n- 46 -\nadding the difference in column letter and row number between the source cell and destination cell\nto each cell address in the expression that is entered into the source cell.\nExample: When the expression A1+5 in cell A6 is copied into cell B8, the expression B3+5 is\nentered into cell B8.\n(3) In a cell copy operation, when the source cell holds an expression containing a cell address, the cell\nreference method that does not change either of or both the column letter and row number of the\ncell address is called an absolute reference. A dollar symbol “$” is placed immediately before\neither of or both the column letter and row number to which an absolute reference is applied.\nExample: When the expression $A$1+$A2+A$5 in cell B1 is copied into cell C4, the expression\n$A$1+$A5+B$5 is entered into cell C4.\n(4) In a cell copy operation, when the source cell holds an expression that refers to another worksheet,\nthe name of the referenced worksheet does not change at the copy destination.\nExample: When the expression Sheet1!A1 in cell A6 of the worksheet “Sheet2” is copied into\ncell B8 of the worksheet “Sheet3”, the expression Sheet1!B3 is entered into cell B8 of\n“Sheet3”.\n6. Functions\nThe functions defined in the table below are available for use in an expression.\nFormat Description\nReturns the sum of the values in a specified cellrange.\nSUM(cell range1)) Example: SUM(A1:B5) returns the sum of the values in the cell range\nA1:B5.\nAVG(cell range1)) Returns the average of the values in a specified cell range.\nSAMPLE_STD_DEV Sample standard deviation: Returns the standard deviation of the sample\n(cell range1)) values in a specified cell range.\nPOPULATION_STD_D Population standard deviation: Returns the standard deviation of the\nEV(cell range1)) population values in a specified cell range.\nMAX(cell range1)) Returns the maximum value in a specified cell range.\nMIN(cell range1)) Returns the minimum value in a specified cell range.\nReturns the value of expression1 when the value of the logical expression is\nIF(logical expression, true, and returns the value of expression 2 when it is false.\nexpression 1, expression Example: IF(B3 ˃ A4, ‘Chicago’, C4) returns the character string\n2) “Chicago”, if the value in cell B3 is greater than the value in\ncell A4. Otherwise, the value in cell C4 is returned.\nCOUNT(cell range) Returns the number of non-blank cells in a specified cell range.\nReturns the number of cells within a specified cell range that meet the\nspecified search condition. The search condition is described using a\ncombination of a comparison operator and an expression, and the value of\neach cell contained in the cell range is evaluated using the specified\nCOUNTIF(cell range, comparison operator.\nsearch condition) Example 1: COUNTIF(H5:L9, > A1) returns the number of cells in cell\nrange H5:L9 that hold a greater value than the value in cell\nA1 .\nExample 2: COUNTIF (H5:L9, = ‘ABC’) returns the number of cells in\nthe cell range H5:L9 that hold the character string “ABC”.\n- 47 -\nInteger: Rounds a value down to the maximuminteger that is less than or\nINT (arithmetic equal to the value of a specified arithmetic expression.\nexpression) Example 1: INTEGER(3.9) returns 3.\nExample 2: INTEGER(−3.9) returns −4.\nModulo arithmetic: Returns the remainder after the value of arithmetic\nexpression 1 (dividend) is divided by the value of arithmetic expression 2\nMOD(arithmetic\n(divisor). The equation below holds for functions MOD and INT.\nexpression 1, arithmetic\nMOD(x, y) = x − y * INT(x / y)\nexpression 2)\nExample 1: MOD(10, 3) returns 1.\nExample 2: MOD(−10, 3) returns 2.\nSquare root: Returns the non-negative square root of the value of a\nSQRT(arithmetic\nspecified arithmetic expression.

Otherwise, it returns false.\nNOT(logical Returns false when the value of a specifiedlogical expression is true, and\nexpression) returns true when the value of the logical expression is false.\nROUNDUP(arithmetic Returns the value of a specified arithmetic expression that is rounded to the\nexpression, position) position specified. The function ROUNDUP rounds the value up,\nROUNDOFF(arithmetic ROUNDOFF rounds the value off, and ROUNDDOWN rounds the value\nexpression, position) down. Here, the position is the number of places as counted from left to\nright with the first position being 0.\nROUNDDOWN\nExample 1: ROUNDUP(−314.159, 2) returns −314.16.\n(arithmetic expression,\nExample 2: ROUNDUP(314.159, −2) returns 400.\nposition)\nExample 3: ROUNDUP(314.159, 0) returns 315.\nTreats the value of expression 1, expression 2, and all other expressionsas\nCONCATENATE a character string, and returns these as a single character string joined in\n(expression 1, order of the arguments.\nexpression 2, ...) 2) Example: CONCATENATE(‘Chicago’, ‘Washington’, 123, 456) returns\nthe character string “ChicagoWashington123456”.\nReturns the rank order of the value of a specified arithmetic expression in a\ncell range in ascending order when the order option is 0, and in descending\nRANK(arithmetic\norder when the order option is 1. Here, if the same value occurs more\nexpression, cell range1),\nthan once in the cell range, these values are given the same rank order and\norder option)\nthe subsequent rank order is set as this rank order plus the number of cells\nin the same rank order.\nReturns a uniform random number (real value) that is greater than or equal\nRANDOM( )\nto 0 and less than 1.\nTable lookup: Counts each row andcolumn from the top left position of a\nTLOOKUP(cell range,\nspecified cell range as 1, 2, ..., and returns the value of a cell at the location\nrow position, column\nspecified using a row position and a column position.\nposition)\nExample: TLOOKUP(A3:H11, 2, 5) returns the value of cell E4.\n- 48 -\nVertical lookup: Scans the leftmost column of a specified cell range\nvertically from top to bottom, and searches for the first row with a cell that\nmeets the search option. For the row found, counts each column from the\nleftmost column of the cell range as 1, 2, ..., and returns the value of the\ncell in the column specified by the column position.\nVLOOKUP • When the search option is 0: searches for values that matches the\n(expression, cell range, expression value.\ncolumn position, search • When the search option is 1: searches for the maximum value that is less\noption) than or equal to the expression value. Here, the leftmost column must\nbe sorted in ascending order from top to bottom in advance.\nExample: VLOOKUP(15, A2:E10, 5, 0) searches the leftmost column in\nthe cell range from cell A2 to A10. Under this condition, if the\nvalue 15 is first found in cell A6, the value in cell E6 is returned,\nwhich is located at the 5th column E in the same row as cell A6.\nHorizontal lookup: Scans the top rowof a cell range horizontally from\nleft to right, and searches for the first column with a cell that meets the\nsearch option. For the column found, counts each row from the top row of\nthe cell range as 1, 2, ..., and returns the value of the cell in the row\nspecified by the row position.\n• When the search option is 0: searches for values that matches the\nHLOOKUP\nexpression value.\n(expression, cell range,\n• When the search option is 1: searches for the maximum value that is less\nrow position, search\nthan or equal to the expression value. Here, the top row must be sorted\noption)\nin ascending order from left to right in advance.\nExample: HLOOKUP(15, A2:G6, 5, 1) searches the top row in the cell\nrange from cell A2 to G2. Under this condition, if the\nmaximum value less than or equal to 15 is first found in cell D2,\nthe value in cell D6 is returned, which is located at the 5th row 6\nin the same column as cell D2.\nNotes: 1) Values other than numeric values contained in the cell range that is passed as an argument\nare not processed.\n2) One or more expressions can be passed as a list of arguments.\n- 49 -",
